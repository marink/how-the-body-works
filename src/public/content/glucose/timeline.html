<h2>Timeline: How Long It Takes for Food to Become Glucose</h2>
<p>From the moment you eat, it takes some time for carbohydrates to be digested into glucose and then for that glucose
    to appear in your bloodstream. This timeline can vary based on the type of food (simple sugar vs. complex carb,
    liquid vs. solid, etc.) and individual metabolism. Below is a general timeline of what happens after you eat a
    carbohydrate-rich food:</p>
<!-- Placeholder: A visual timeline illustration could be inserted here -->
<ul className="timeline">
    <li><strong>0–5 minutes:</strong> <em>Ingestion & Chewing.</em> Eating begins and chewing breaks food into smaller
        pieces. Salivary amylase in the mouth starts digesting starches into sugars almost immediately.</li>
    <li><strong>10–30 minutes:</strong> <em>Stomach Phase.</em> Food reaches the stomach and is mixed with gastric
        juices. Carbohydrates aren’t fully broken down here, but the meal is liquefied. Some simple sugars may begin to
        be absorbed in the stomach, but most digestion is still ahead.</li>
    <li><strong>30–60 minutes:</strong> <em>Intestinal Digestion.</em> The now-liquid food (chyme) enters the small
        intestine. Enzymatic action breaks down carbohydrates to glucose, which starts getting absorbed into the
        bloodstream. Blood glucose levels begin to rise.</li>
    <li><strong>~90 minutes:</strong> <em>Blood Sugar Peak.</em> Blood glucose typically reaches its peak about 1 to 2
        hours after eating&#8203;:contentReference[ oaicite-14]/index=14/&#8203;:contentReference[
        oaicite-15]/index=15/.
        This is when the concentration of glucose in the blood is highest, assuming the meal contained significant
        carbohydrates.</li>
    <li><strong>2–3 hours:</strong> <em>Return to Baseline.</em> In a healthy individual, blood sugar levels drop back
        toward pre-meal (fasting) levels within about 2 to 3 hours after eating, as insulin has moved glucose out of the
        bloodstream and into cells&#8203;:contentReference[ oaicite-16]/index=16/. Any glucose that isn’t immediately
        needed for energy has been stored (in the liver, muscles, or as fat). You may start to feel hungry again as
        blood sugar dips, depending on the meal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that this timeline can be faster for simple carbohydrates (like sugary drinks, which can cause blood
    sugar to rise within minutes) and slower for meals high in protein, fat, or fiber (which delay digestion and glucose
    absorption). The overall process from eating to peak blood glucose is generally within an hour or two for most
    carbohydrate-containing meals.</p>
<p>In essence, diets rich in refined carbohydrates can push the body into a harmful
    cycle of sugar spikes and insulin surges. Complex carbohydrates with fiber (like whole grains, fruits, and
    vegetables)
    digest more slowly, causing smaller blood sugar increases and less strain on insulin response.
    Managing carbohydrate quality and quantity is key to preventing insulin resistance and its consequences.</p>
